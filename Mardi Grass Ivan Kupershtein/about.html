            <h1>Mardi Gras New Orleans</h1>
            <p>
                Mardi Gras is so much more special when you understand what you’re celebrating and what each tradition
                means to the generations of parade-goers who have stood on parade routes before you. There is a story
                and a purpose behind everything you’ll experience during Carnival Time – from the king cake you’ll eat
                to the flambeaux who light the parades at night.
            </p>
            <p>
                The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th
                and 18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf
                Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies.

            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in
                what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
                celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the
                festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and
                dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An account
                from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in
                the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed
                whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de
                Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras
                celebration.

                James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces describes New Orleans
                Mardi Gras in 1835:[2]

                Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun,
                frolic, and comic masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active
                operation. Men and boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert
                themselves to invent and appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and
                disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads;
                demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the moon; mermaids;
                satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches,
                cars, &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming,
                fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.

                In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to
                observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mystick
                Krewe of Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what
                New Orleans had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than
                this parade that the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a
                certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To a certain extent, New Orleans
                'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how their business prowess
                helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival
                passed from Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the
                nineteenth century. The spectacle of Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to
                compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans
                culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American."[3]

                In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday.[4] War, economic, political, and weather
                conditions sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American
                Civil War, World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.[4]

                In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved to
                surrounding communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual
                came to the city. Masking, costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops
                maintaining order. Guardsmen prevented crimes against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce
                laws regulating morality or drug use; for these reasons, some in the French Quarter bohemian community
                recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.

                In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including
                Mardi Gras Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion,
                gender or sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other public licenses.[5] Shortly after the
                law was passed, the city demanded that these krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the
                long-standing traditions of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of these groups. In protest—and
                because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to demand otherwise-private membership
                lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading.[6] Proteus did parade in the 1992
                Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000.

                Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two
                federal courts later declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment
                rights of free association, and an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the
                ordinance.[7] The US Supreme Court refused to hear the city's appeal from this decision.

                Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays
                dues, and any member can have a place on a parade float.
                Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed "Carnival
                Edition"
                lithographs of parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and
                floats were
                always carefully guarded before the procession). At first, these reproductions were small,
                and details
                could not be clearly seen. But beginning in 1886 with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other
                Worlds," these
                chromolithographs could be produced in full, saturated color, doing justice to the float and
                costume
                designs of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these designers'
                work was
                brought to life by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who for 40 years
                was
                responsible for creating all of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.

                1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside
                over the
                first daytime parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the
                businessmen
                introduced Romanoff's family colors of purple, green and gold as Carnival's official colors.
                Purple
                stands for justice; gold for power; and green for faith. This was also the Mardi Gras season
                that
                Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease to Love," was cemented, due in part to the
                Duke's
                fondness for the tune.

                The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans instead of
                France,
                culminating with Comus' magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in
                which exotic
                paper-mache' animal costumes served as the basis for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and
                local
                officials, including Governor Henry Warmoth. In 1875, Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi
                Gras Act,"
                making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday in Louisiana, which it still is.

                Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from
                private social
                clubs with restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are
                completely
                funded by their members, New Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"
                In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that
                form our
                current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was
                formed and
                paraded from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along
                on wheels
                by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the
                coming Lenten
                meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.

                New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated
                openly in New
                Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor,
                the Marquis
                de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans
                Mardi Gras
                balls of today.

                The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish
                colonial
                governing body. That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the
                first of
                hundreds of clubs and carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.

                By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and
                horseback riders to
                celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's
                members and
                lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives
                formed the
                Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization.
                Comus brought
                magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked
                balls. Krewe
                members remained anonymous.

                In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also the
                first
                recorded account of Mardi Gras "throws."</p>

            <p>
                LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American
                politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana, a post she
                has held since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to
                hold the post. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on
                the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018. Cantrell was inaugurated as
                mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
                history.[28] Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and
                Families, with the goal of creating a strategic plan to address families
                in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction
                Council, tasked with finding solutions to violent crime.[29] Starting
                with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city
                use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city
                infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and green
                spaces.[30] As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New
                Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid manufacturers and
                distributors. During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature,
                Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement with Governor John Bel
                Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured
                $50 million in upfront funding for the city's infrastructure needs as
                well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the city.[32]
                Following the approval of the Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters
                approved 3 of the 4 proposals Mayor Cantrell and the City Council put on
                the ballot in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million
                bond sale and a tax on short-term rental properties, as well the
                establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home
                Rule Charter.
