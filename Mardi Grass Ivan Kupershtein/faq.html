                    Mardi Gras dates back thousands of years to pagan celebrations of spring and fertility. When
                    Christianity arrived in Rome, religious leaders decided to incorporate the popular tradition into
                    the new faith, so the excess and debauchery of the Carnival season became a prelude to Lent, the 40
                    days of penance between Ash Wednesday and Easter. Mardi Gras marks the final day of feasting and
                    revelry before the fasting, prayer and moderation of Lent. So, in its most basic form, Carnival and
                    Mardi Gras is all about overindulging.

                    The first Carnival season made its way to the United States via the French. Many historians say the
                    first American Mardi Gras was on March 3, 1699, when French explorers Bienville and Iberville landed
                    in Louisiana. As the years passed, the holiday became more lavish -- and more festive.

                    The first recorded New Orleans Carnival parade occurred in 1827, when a group of students in
                    colorful costumes danced through the streets.

                    In New Orleans today, the early weeks of Carnival are marked with elaborate balls. These balls,
                    which are invitation-only, celebrate the chosen royalty for each krewe, or private club, and also
                    serve as a "coming out" for the season's crop of debutantes, the daughters of the city's social
                    scions.

                    The final weeks, mainly the two leading up to Mardi Gras, are packed with street parades featuring
                    bands, marching groups and large floats packed with costumed riders throwing beads and other
                    trinkets to the masses in the streets. Weekly king cake parties are held in neighborhoods, schools
                    and offices.

                    By Ash Wednesday, New Orleanians are back at work, albeit a little sluggishly.

                    The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day
                    (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is
                    on a different day each year. Fat Tuesday changes every year
                    because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                    Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday. Most visitors plan
                    to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and
                    stay through Ash Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when
                    Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.

                    inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors.

                    The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very
                    warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will change from one extreme to the
                    other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes
                    since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon. Since you
                    will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and
                    clothes that can get somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the
                    forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely
                    want to bring a raincoat!

                    On Mardi Gras, however, costuming is expected. Many New Orleanians go for the satirical, the ironic,
                    the bizarre or just something pretty. Costumes are by no means a requirement, but Mardi Gras is a
                    great time to join the fun. Often, families or groups of friends will don a group-themed costume.
